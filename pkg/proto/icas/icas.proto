// The Indirect Content Addressable Storage (ICAS) is a Buildbarn
// specific protocol. The ICAS is similar to the CAS, except that it
// does not store actual contents of objects. Instead, it stores
// references (URLs) to locations where the actual object may be found.
// These references can be expanded by using
// ReferenceExpandingBlobAccess, thereby making it behave like a CAS.
//
// The ICAS can be used to integrate external corpora into the CAS
// without fully ingesting them. This may be desirable if the external
// corpus is large, while only a fraction of it is used by build
// actions.

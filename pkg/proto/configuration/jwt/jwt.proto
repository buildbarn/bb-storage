    //
    // - If the HTTP server is unavailable, this process wouldn't be
    //   able to launch properly.
    //
    // - For large build clusters having many storage nodes, such an
    //   approach would lead to an unnecessary number of requests

    // use the jwks_file option in combination with a cron job that
    // fetches the JWKS. When running on Kubernetes, one may create a
    // CronJob that writes the JWKS into a ConfigMap. The JWKS can then
    // be accessed by creating a volume mount for the ConfigMap. An
    // example implementation of such a cron job is provided under
    // cmd/sync_jwks_to_configmap.

  // This option allows specifying a boolean JMESPath expression that
  // can be used to place additional requirements on the presence of
  // claims and their values. For example, it is possible to require
  // that the "aud" (Audience) claim is equal to "MyBuildCluster" by
  // using the following JMESPath expression:
  //
  //     payload.aud == 'MyBuildCluster'
  //
  // In case no additional requirements against claims need to be made,
  // it is possible to use the following JMESPath expression (including
  // the backticks):
  //
  //     `true`
  //
  // More details about JMESPath can be found at https://jmespath.org/.
  //

  //     {
  //       "files": map<string, any>,
  //       "payload": any
  //     }

  // buildbarn.configuration.jmespath.Expression configuration.
  //
  // "payload" corresponds to the JSON Web Token's payload, which is
  // represented as a map of string keys to values.
  //
  // It is recommended that this feature is only used for making
  // authentication decisions; not authorization decisions. The reason
  // being that validation failures will cause gRPC requests to fail
  // with code UNAUTHENTICATED; not PERMISSION_DENIED.

  // JMESPath expression for converting claims to a Protobuf message of

  //
  // The following expression would cause all of the claims in the JSON
  // Web Token's payload to become private authentication metadata:
  //
  //     {"private": payload}
  //
  // The following expression demonstrates how given a JSON Web Token
  // consisting of "given_name" and "family_name" fields can be
  // transformed to authentication metadata with a public "name" field.
  //
  //     {
  //       "public": {
  //         "name": join(' ', [payload.given_name, payload.family_name])
  //       }
  //     }

  // extracted from the token:
  //
  //     `{}`

type ShardSelector func(int) bool

// ShardPermuter is an algorithm for turning a hash into a series of indices
// corresponding to backends capable of serving blobs corresponding with that
// hash.
//
// As backends may be unavailable (e.g., drained) or replication strategies may
// be applied to duplicate blobs, it is important that an actual permutation is
// returned to ensure every backend is given a chance. It is permitted to
// spuriously generate the same index multiple times.
